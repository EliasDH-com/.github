## 🖖Introduction

To maintain consistency across all files in our projects, we have established the following formatting guidelines. These rules apply to all file types, ensuring clarity, readability, and maintainability.

## ✨How To

- General Formatting Rules
    1. **Indentation:** Use 4 spaces instead of tabs for indentation.
    2. **Line Endings** Use LF (\n) as the standard line ending.
    3. **Encoding:** All files must be encoded in UTF-8.
    4. **Maximum Line Length:** Lines should not exceed 120 characters, where possible.
    5. **Trailing Whitespace:** No trailing spaces at the end of lines.
    6. **Newline at EOF:** At the end of each file, no extra line should exist.

- Comment Header
    - Every file must begin with a standard comment header, formatted appropriately for the file type. This header provides authorship information and reference details.

- Example Comment Headers
    - Shell, Python, Ruby, etc.
    ```shell
    ############################
    # @author EliasDH Team     #
    # @see https://eliasdh.com #
    # @since 01/01/2025        #
    ############################
    ```
    - HTML, XML, etc.
    ```html
    <!--Author EliasDH Team-->
    ```
    - CSS, SCSS, etc.
    ```css
    /**
        * @author EliasDH Team
        * @see https://eliasdh.com
        * @since 01/01/2025
    **/
    ```
    - BAT
    ```bat
    :: @author EliasDH Team
    :: @see https://eliasdh.com
    :: @since 01/01/2025
    ```

These guidelines must be followed across all projects to ensure a uniform and professional coding standard. Deviations from these rules should be justified and documented where necessary.
